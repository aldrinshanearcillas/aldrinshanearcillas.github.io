                    If ever that I have a chance I want to have a job with high salary because I want my family to have a
                    better life especially I want to repay the support that I receive from big brother, and big sisters.
                    They supported us in everything I want to repay them someday and show them that I have a got a good job.

                <p>
                    It takes me interest to be a web developer when I created a website. It is like I can do anything that I
                    want in that website if you have broad knowledge about it. I think it can improve your creativity while
                    doing it because one of my weaknesses is that I don't do well in terms in designing.
