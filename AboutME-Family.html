            <p>
                Our family structure is a little bit complicated.
                My mother has past relationship with 3 men and we are 8 siblings in the family.
                My side is from the second husband of my mother which consist us of 4 siblings but the other two is twin
                sisters and they live with my aunt. The first siblings is my big stepbrother and 2 stepsisters which
                they have already a family and we are not grow up together so we are not so close to each other. The
                youngest one is from the third husband of my mother which is currently living with us. Although, we are
                not grow up together we are still have connection with each other and get together sometimes.
